        <h3>Electric Potential</h3>

        <p>Electric potential is one of the central concepts in electrostatics and helps us understand how electrical energy is stored and how charges behave under the influence of electric fields. In simple terms, electric potential (often denoted by <strong>V</strong>) at a point means the amount of work done per unit charge to bring a small positive test charge from infinity (or some reference point) to that point, without any acceleration.</p>

        <h3>Definition and Unit</h3>
        <p>Formally, the electric potential at a point is defined as:</p>
        <p><strong>V = W / q</strong></p>
        <p>where <strong>W</strong> is the work done in bringing a charge <strong>q</strong> from infinity to the given point. The SI unit of electric potential is the <strong>volt (V)</strong>, which is equivalent to <em>joule per coulomb (J/C)</em>.</p>

        <h3>Potential Due to a Point Charge</h3>
        <p>For a point charge <strong>Q</strong> located in free space, the potential at a distance <strong>r</strong>from the charge is given by:</p>
        <p><strong>V = k · Q / r</strong></p>
        <p>Here, <strong>k</strong> = 1 / (4πε₀) is Coulomb’s constant and ε₀ is the permittivity of free space. The sign of the potential depends on whether Q is positive (giving a positive potential) or negative (giving a negative potential). As r increases, V decreases, approaching zero at infinity.</p>

        <h3>Relation Between Electric Field and Potential</h3>
        <p>Electric field <strong>E</strong> and electric potential V are closely related. In fact, the field is often described as the negative gradient (rate of change) of the potential:</p>
        <p><strong>E = – dV / dr</strong></p>
        <p>This means that where the potential changes rapidly with distance, the electric field is strong; where the potential is nearly constant, the field is weak. Also, equipotential surfaces (surfaces of constant V) are always perpendicular to electric field lines.</p>

        <h3>Equipotential Surfaces</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><p>An equipotential surface is a surface on which all points have the same electric potential.</li>
            <li><p>No work is done when a charge moves anywhere along an equipotential surface because the potential is constant.</li>
            <li><p>Equipotential surfaces are always at right angles to the electric field lines, because the field does no work in a direction perpendicular to itself.</li>
            <li><p>Examples include the spherical surface around a point charge and planes in a uniform electric field.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Potential Energy of a System of Charges</h3>
        <p>When more than one charge is involved, the concept of potential energy becomes important. If two charges q<sub>1</sub> and q<sub>2</sub> are separated by distance r, the potential energy U of this system is:</p>
        <p><strong>U = k · q<sub>1</sub> · q<sub>2</sub> / r</strong></p>
        <p>This energy represents work that has been done (or must be done) to assemble the system of charges from infinity. For multiple charges, the total potential energy is the algebraic sum of potential energies of all interacting pairs.</p>

        <h3>Applications and Importance</h3>
        <p>The concept of electric potential is foundational in many areas of physics and engineering:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><p>It provides insight into how charges will move: a positive test charge will move from higher potential to lower potential spontaneously.</li>
            <li><p>Electric potential helps to explain circuits, capacitors, and how energy is stored in electric fields.
            </li>
            <li><p>In real-world applications, it is essential for designing devices like capacitors, voltmeters, and high-voltage equipment.</li>
            <li><p>Understanding potential and potential energy is also crucial in fields such as electrostatics,
                electronics, and power systems.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Summary</h3>
        <p>In summary, electric potential is a scalar quantity that captures how much “electric work” is associated with a position in an electric field. By relating potential to field strength and potential energy, we gain a deeper understanding of charge interactions and energy transformations in electrostatic systems. Mastering this concept paves the way for tackling more advanced topics like capacitance, dielectric materials, and alternating current systems.</p>
