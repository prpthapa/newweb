        <p class="para">Inorganic Chemistry is the branch of chemistry that studies the properties, structures, and reactions of inorganic compounds, which generally do not contain carbon-hydrogen (C–H) bonds. Unlike organic chemistry, which focuses on carbon compounds, inorganic chemistry covers metals, minerals, acids, bases, salts, and coordination compounds. It helps us understand the chemical behavior of elements and compounds in nature and their practical applications in daily life and industry. Inorganic chemistry is divided into several main areas. Coordination chemistry studies compounds in which a central metal atom or ion is bonded to surrounding molecules or ions called ligands. These compounds are important in biological systems, industrial catalysts, and materials science. Solid-state chemistry examines the structure and properties of solids, including metals, ceramics, and minerals, which are used in electronics and construction. Acid-base and salt chemistry explores the reactions, strength, and uses of acids, bases, and salts, which are essential in industry, medicine, and household products. Transition metals and their compounds are another important area, as they have unique properties like variable oxidation states and colored compounds. Inorganic chemistry has numerous real-life applications. It is crucial in manufacturing metals, fertilizers, ceramics, glass, and pigments. It plays a role in environmental chemistry, water purification, and developing materials for electronics and energy storage. Understanding inorganic compounds also helps in designing medicines, catalysts, and chemical sensors. Studying inorganic chemistry builds analytical and problem-solving skills. It helps scientists understand the properties of elements, predict chemical reactions, and apply this knowledge in technology, medicine, and industry. Overall, inorganic chemistry is a vital branch of science that connects fundamental chemical principles with practical applications, shaping modern technology and improving daily life."</p>
